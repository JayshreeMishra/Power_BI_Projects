Failed Banks Project
This project provides a dataset of all banks that have failed in the United States since 1980. The dataset includes information on the bank's name, location, date of failure, and the reasons for failure.

The project was created by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to help financial institutions learn from the mistakes of failed banks and prevent future failures.

The dataset can be used to answer questions such as:

What are the most common reasons for bank failures?
What are the characteristics of banks that are more likely to fail?
How can banks reduce their risk of failure?
What are the lessons that can be learned from past bank failures?
